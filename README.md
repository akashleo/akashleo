# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Akash

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here I keep all the things that i love building or stealing. 
I am a Frontend Engineer, but I like to keep my hands dirty with all kinds of technologies. When I'm not doing any of these, I cook, and like cook for real. 
Get in touch if you wanna build something fun and that can be of use to people.
