Hey, I'm Akash,
welcome to my github corner, here I keep all the things that i love building or stealing. 
I am a Frontend Engineer and i like building products with good UX, but I also like to keep my hands dirty with all kinds of technologies. 

When I'm not doing any of these, I cook, go for a bike ride or try my hand at songwriting. 

Get in touch if you wanna build something fun/cool and that can be of use to people. @akashleo_tw
Also check out my repositories and star them if you find them interesting.


** Actively looking for jobs currently. **
